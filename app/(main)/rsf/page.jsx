            RSF was formed to increase faculty-student and student-student
            interactions by organizing talks to disseminate experiences,
            knowledge, learning etc. Each event should be kept in record by
            respective departmental DPPC/CPPC/SPPC. The forum will be
            independent to form managers in their group.
